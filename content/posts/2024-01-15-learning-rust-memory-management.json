  "content": "Today I explored Rust's unique ownership and borrowing system. It's fascinating how the compiler ensures memory safety at compile time without a garbage collector.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Ownership Rules:**\n1. Each value has an owner\n2. There can only be one owner at a time\n3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped\n\n**Borrowing:**\n- You can have either one mutable reference OR any number of immutable references\n- References must always be valid\n\n## Example\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = &s1; // Immutable borrow\n    println!(\"{} {}\", s1, s2);\n}\n```\n\nThis mental model takes time to internalize, but once it clicks, you can write incredibly safe and performant code.",
